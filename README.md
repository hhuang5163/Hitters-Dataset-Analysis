# Hitters-Dataset-Analysis
Analysis of the Hitters Dataset, in which baseball players' statistics are used to predict their salary.</br>
<ul>
  <li>Determined the most important features in predicting baseball players' salaries using:
     <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression
        <li>Best Subsets
        <li>Step-wise approaches (forward and backward)
        <li>Lasso
        <li>Elastic Net
        <li>Adaptive Lasso
     </ul>
   <li>Fit and visualized regularization paths for:
      <ul>
        <li>Lasso
        <li>Elastic Net at &#593 = 0.33, 0.66
        <li>Adaptive Lasso
      </ul>
   <li>Determined the average prediction mean squared error for:
      <ul>
        <li>Least Squares
        <li>Ridge Regression
        <li>Best Subsets
        <li>Step-wise approaches (forward and backward)
        <li>Lasso
        <li>Elastic Net
        <li>Adaptive Lasso
      </ul>
